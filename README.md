# Word Talk for iOS

# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!

The idea is an iOS app for helping children with sight words. A parent can go in, add the desired words to the list, and the child can go through the words saying each one. Powered by Google Cloud's Speech to Text service. Google's Speech to Text service allows for hints to be given, so even if the child gets close to pronouncing it correctly, there is a higher change of the application correctly recognizing it.
